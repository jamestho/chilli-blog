Perhaps a year or so ago, it would have been quite difficult to find information online regarding the ethics of the various DNA testing companies but thankfully, as more people take DNA tests this topic is starting to become more mainstream.  

I believe DNA testing companies should provide a number of new initiatives which will mean that they should accept more responsibility for the impact that their DNA test results can have on private individuals.  When I took my first DNA test then I initially thought that it could be a great tool to benefit genealogists, such as orphans to be re-united with their parents, or perhaps by taking a DNA test I am able to leave a permanent 'beacon' signalling to later generations that 'this is really me' without the hassle, or ambiguity of having to follow a paper-trail.  Often these are positive effects of having taken a DNA test, but there is as always another side to taking a DNA test.  Little thought is given by the DNA testing companies as to the unexpected impact that their results can have; for example, someone finding out that who they believed was their father actually isn't.  I believe DNA testing companies should as a minimum provide emotional support for people who discover a new sibling or parent. Other DNA testing companies should provide basic training and vetting to become a DNA forum admin.  Currently as far as I'm aware none of this is offered by any DNA testing organisation.  To keep DNA testing relevant in today's world then I believe that DNA testing companies should provide a minimum framework to their customers which encompasses emotional support, and basic vetting and training for their Project Admins.

### Family Tree DNA Project Admins

I logged onto Family Tree DNA (FTDNA) and as I was looking through the surname projects and I realised that the surnames that I was looking for didn't exist as projects.  So, I duely completed an online form to have the groups set-up, and also to become an administrator for the groups.  I was surprised at how easy it was.  However I now find myself in the position that people can now share really quite detailed DNA information with me when they join the project.  When I applied to be the project administrator there was no exam, nor an online course that I needed to complete to prove that I could reasonably understood DNA tests, nor that I had reached a certain level of competance in being able to understand other people's DNA results.  I did have to accept an form that I would act in an ethical way.  There are also help pages on their website that I can read, but there is no formal training, or ethics exam that I need to take to say that I will do the best job that I possibly can at running the project, and to respect other people's DNA data.  I was chatting to another DNA project admin that I know, and I felt   

### 23AndMe Medical Testing 

Some companies such as 23andMe alongside a number of smaller DNA testing companies through analyzing your DNA for specific genetic mutations are able to inform you about your risk of developing a range of conditions.  For example, 23andMe covers more than 10 different disease risks, including how likely you are of developing Breast Cancer, Parkinson's Disease, Celiac disease (glucose intolerance) amongst others.

As this article has outlined, I believe that whilst DNA testing is generally positive, then there are certain areas that DNA testing companies can improve upon.  I would certainly like to see improvements in the areas that I've outlined, and I think that any step by DNA companies to move forward to provde better support, and governance will certainly be better for all consumers.

I'm not a geneticist, a chemist, nor a biologist!  I'm an IT specialist with more than a passing interest in DNA testing.  I have done several DNA tests myself, and I am also a FTDNA DNA admin for two surname groups.  I started out by simply wanting to better understand what the DNA tests actually mean in the real-world, and to pass that information onto others in hopefully a reasonably simple way.  I am self taught in this respect, so if I have made any mistakes then please do send me an email: james@chilli.ai and I will happily correct it!
