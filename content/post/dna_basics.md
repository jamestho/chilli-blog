With more and more people doing DNA testing these days, I often read on r/Genealogy that people want to have more information on what kinds of DNA tests are available, which is the most relevant to them, and also how to interpret their DNA results.  So I wrote this blog post with this in mind.

### TL;DR

> TL;DR means Too Long; Didn't Read - it's a super-brief synopsis of the larger article.
>

Our body has trillions of cells, and DNA is located within every cell's nucleus.  When it comes to extracting DNA then DNA testing companies first search for the chromosomes, and then dig down a bit more to find your genes and extract the DNA from them.  DNA testing companies focus on testing only 0.1% of your DNA, and they compare your DNA against other people's DNA samples.  They note the variance between the yours and others DNA samples; if there is a strong match then they know that you're related.

### The Science behind DNA testing

It's thought that within the human body of the average person there are 30 to 40 trillion cells. Each cell has a nucleus, which is in charge of controlling that cell's activities, and includes DNA, and other genetic material.  

DNA is two molecules that exist in the nucleus of every living single cell within your body.  DNA basically includes instructions for building and operating all living things within you; it makes your eyes into eyes, and also makes your eyes work - it's responsible for making everything that makes you, you! 

Did you know that if you stretched your DNA out that's contained within a single nucleus it would be 2 meters long!  If you did the same for your whole body then it would stretch out to be twice the diameter of the solar system!! 

99.9% of all human DNA is the same; it's simply that 0.1% that determines everything else, so how we look, and also any genetic diseases you might have are all determined by that 0.1%!

### DNA, Chromosomes, and Genes

*DNA* stands for deoxyribonucleic acid, and it's a chemical that is made up of two very long molecules.  The molecules are arranged in a spiral, much like a twisted ladder, and you might have heard it called a 'double-helix' structure.

A DNA molecule can be broken down into *genes*  whose job it is to carry information for particular *traits*, such as the colour of your eyes, or the type of hair that you have  - both the colour, and the type of hair.  Each gene occurs approximately 21,000 times within a chromosome.  

In a cell nucleus, DNA is organised into coiled strands called a *chromosome*.  People have 46 chomosomes in each cell.  Half come from one parent and the other half from your other parent; so we have 23 chromosomes from each parent, in effect.  Chromosomes in humans can be divided into two distinct types:  22 are called *autosomes*, and one pair called an *allosome*, or it's usually referred to as the sex chromosome.  This means that we have a total of 46 chromosomes in each cell nucleus. 

You inherit one half of each sex chromosome from each of your parents, and they will either be X, or Y chromosomes:

- Two X chromosomes - if you have both, you're female
- One X and one Y chromosome - if you have this combination, then you're male

### Seeing the bigger picture

So if you had an electron microscope handy, then I imagine that you would see something like this:

1. Inside the cell nucleus you would see 46 chromosomes.
2. Zooming further into a single chromosome you would see multiple genes 
3. Within your genes you would finally see your DNA base pairs which would give you your traits

## How and what do DNA companies test?

### Bases & DNA Sequence

If you imagine the double-helix image once again.  Each one of the rungs of the ladder so to speak, is called a *base pair*, and each base pair has two different repeating compounds which are called *bases* or *nucleotides*.  There are only 4 bases that exist within the DNA world, and they're called:

- Adenine (A)
- Cytosine (C)
- Thymine (T)
- Guanine (G)

The bases always buddy-up in a very specific way; A always teams-up with T, and C always teams-up with G.  It will always be like this as A cannot pair with C or G due to the geometry of each base. So looking at the picture above, then the different colours of the rungs of the ladder represent Adenine, Cytosine, Thymine, and Guanine.

If you could travel down the ladder then you will start to see a specific sequence of the A, C, G, T bases.  That sequence is referred to as the *DNA sequence*.

The DNA sequence of a chromosome can be subdivided into sub-sequences where each sub-sequence is
either a gene (measured in *centimorgans*) or is the space between genes. The space between genes is referred to as junk DNA!

I find it helps If I imagine that I have a 2 meter length of string, and I mark each section of the string as a gene, then junk-DNA, then another gene, and another section of junk-DNA, and so on all the way to the end.

### Centimorgans - the key to it all

Thomas Hunt Morgan was a geneticist whose work involved working out where and when genes separated.  So his name became used as a way to measure the distance along a chromosome which related to a certain frequency of separation.  A frequency of seperation is simply a way to determine when a gene starts, and also when a gene stops.  There is no such thing as a single morgan, but 1/100th of a morgan (or 1 centimorgan) is the distance along a chromosome having a 1% frequency of separation.  This distance varies from chromosome to chromosome, and might even vary along a chromosome.  But it's fair to say that on average, 1 centimorgan is approximately 100 base pairs.

### Haplogroups

Sometimes as part of evolution, a single base pair might change from an A&T to a C&G base-pair.  When this happens it's known as a *genetic mutation*.  The mutation can be passed down from a parent to child, and this allows geneticists to place you within a *haplogroup*.  The purpose of a haplogroup is quite simply a way for geneticists to group individuals that share one or more common genetic mutations, as they will all be descended from a common ancestor.  As more people do personal DNA tests then new haplogroups are being created all the time.  Haplogroups are used only to define Y-DNA, and mtDNA results.  

### STR & SNPs - the final piece of the jigsaw

Y-DNA & mtDNA tests compare something called *Y-STR* markers* (Short Tandem Repeat) for two different males. Sometimes DNA testing companies use an alternative to the Y-STR, and it's called a *SNP* (pronounced "snips").  SNP stands for Single Neoclotide Polymorphism.  This is a fancy-pants name which allows the testing company to better determine when a genetic mutation actually occured.  FTDNA has recently moved to using SNPs, as it helps to better determine when a haplogroup occurred as it can be estimated to within 500 years.

## What is the difference between Y-DNA, mtDNA, and Autosomal DNA tests? 

Now we know what DNA is, and why and where we have it, so we are now in a better position to be able to understand the differences between the types of DNA testing that's currently available.  Remember, DNA testing companies are only interested in the 0.1% of the DNA that we send to them, and that's all they test.

### Y-DNA
Only males have the Y chromosome so this test is great if you want to better understand what happened on your father's side of the family.  So this type of test focuses solely on the allosome i.e. the sex chromosome.

Y-DNA is only inherited from father to son, to son, to son etc. So you can trace a direct line between male ancestors all the way back up your tree, but this type of test can only be taken by males.  If you're not male, then you can ask your brother, father, grandfather, uncle, or paternal cousin to take it on your behalf.

With a Y-DNA test it's possible to go back thousands of years, so it is really not very useful for finding close unknown matches - if you're looking for a sibling, or parent then the only test that can really help you is the autosomal one (see below).  It's also difficult to determine exact timeframes, as you can only guesstimate how many generations the genetic mutation actually goes back.

FTDNA does a number of different Y-DNA tests called Y-37, Y-67, Y-111, Y-700, the number relates to the number of STRs that they test - obviously, more is better.  I would say that if you're looking at doing one of these Y-DNA tests I would focus on at least Y-67, or above.  If you take a Y-67 test, then they will still have your DNA on file, so often you can upgrade to a Y-111, or Y-700 test later on without submitting another swap. 

### Mitrochondrial DNA (mtDNA)

This is probably the least known DNA test and helps you to trace your maternal side of the family.  The test can be taken by both males and females, and it focusses on the mitochondrial allosome.  The mitochondrian is a structure that sits inside the human cell, but it's not located within the nucleus. It's job is to provide energy to the cell. There are multiple copies of it that lay *outside* the nucleus.  

Inside the mitochondrian is a round piece of DNA called mtDNA. mtDNA is circular and has 16,569 
DNA base pairs. The mtDNA is composed of three DNA regions - *HVR1*, *HVR2*, and *CR* (Coding Region that has genes).

The two most common mtDNA tests are a sequence of HVR1, and also a sequence of both HVR1 and HVR2. It's recommended that as a minimum you have both sequences tested ie. HVR1, and HVR2.

If you find a match then be aware that a "match" in this context means having an identical mtDNA region (HVR1, HVR2, or CR) as someone else, and NOT one base pair should be different.  For example, the HVR1 region contains 400 DNA base pairs.  An HVR1 low resolution match means you and someone both share the exact and entire 400 base pairs. A single base mismatch can mean a difference of say 1000 years between you and someone else!  So this kind of DNA test is - like the Y-DNA test - not suitable for discovering close relatives at all, as the mtDNA changes incredibly slowly over time.

### Autosomal (atDNA)
Autosomal sometimes referred to as atDNA, is best for tracing ancestors upto 5-6 generations back from your own, so your great-grandparents in effect.  It's popular as it uses 50% of one parent's DNA with 50% of your other parent. So unlike the Y-DNA, and mtDNA tests, which includes only your mothers, or your fathers DNA.  It can't really determine which 50% comes from your parents, unless they also do an autosomal DNA test.  

It will therefore be useful to find siblings, parents, grandparents, cousins etc, and unless your parents have taken a test each it won't be possible to know if you should "go left up your family free, or if you need to turn right"!  That's why I was fortunate enough to be able to get each of my parents to test.

The DNA that they use to test, mutates much, much faster than Y-DNA, or mtDNA so that's why this kind of test can only be used for a limited number of generations within your family tree.

### Which sites offer which DNA tests?

| [My Heritage](https://www.myheritage.com/) |  yes  |  yes  |      yes       |    2.5 million     |

I hope that this article has clarified to some extent what DNA actually is, and how it all works!  It's not such an easy topic to try to simplify to be honest.  I might expand the which sites offer which DNA tests at a later date.  However, in the meantime if you have any questions, or queries then please either use the commenting system, or drop me an email: james@chilli.ai and I'll be happy to answer any questions that you might have! :)

I'm not a geneticist, a chemist, nor a biologist!  I'm an IT specialist with more than a passing interest in DNA testing.  I have done several DNA tests myself, and I am also a FTDNA DNA admin for two surname groups.  I started out by simply wanting to better understand what the DNA tests actually mean in the real-world, and to pass that information onto others in hopefully a reasonably simple way.  I am self taught in this respect, so if I have made any mistakes then please *do* send me an email: james@chilli.ai and I will happily correct it!
