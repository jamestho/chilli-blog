## Introduction

Hey hi, I'm James!

I live in Oxfordshire, UK and I have worked in IT for over 20 years across several different verticals - Publishing, FMCGs, Start-Ups, & Charitable organizations etc. Of the companies that I've worked for many are house-hold names.

I notice that lots of blogs just stick to a single topic and that might actually be for the best.  However I often have thoughts on different subjects which interest me, and therefore I thought that this blog would be a good place for me to get my thoughts, and ideas out into the wider-world.  So, expect blog-posts on subjects as diverse as Tech (Linux, & general web), FOSS & Propriety software, Online Privacy, and finally geneological DNA!

If you have any questions - as I'm not really on many Social Media sites (more about that later!) - please do get in touch via email: james at chilli dot ai
