  - Should you wish to be able to place comments on my site then the following **will apply to you**:

  - Comments are provided by https://commento.io a privacy-focussed commenting platform.  

  - Their privacy policy is located here: https://commento.io/privacy

  - I only allow sign-ups using your email address as this automatically means that you will share the least amount of information with commento.io as is necessary i.e. only your name, and email address. 

  - *The most important points for you to be aware of within their privacy policy is this (correct as of 16th June 2019), as this applies directly to you:*

    - **Authenticating as a visitor of a website embedding the service:**
      When you choose to authenticate yourself as a visitor on a website
      embedding the service, a unique, randomly generated token ("Session")
      will be stored as a cookie in your browser in order to remember you on
      future visits. Upon successfully authenticating yourself with a OAuth
      provider, all the information returned by the provider is stored and
      associated with your Session. This may include, but is not limited to,
      your full name, your email address, your photo, and an URL to your
      public profile. By authenticating yourself as a Vistor on a website
      embedding the service, you consent to allow the service to display all
      information except your email address publicly on all comments you
      create. This information will never be sold to advertisers, marketing
      agencies, or any other organization for user tracking or any other
      purpose.
