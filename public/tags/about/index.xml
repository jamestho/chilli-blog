I live in Oxfordshire, UK and I have worked in IT for over 20 years across several different verticals - Publishing, FMCGs, Start-Ups, &amp;amp; Charitable organizations etc. Of the companies that I&amp;rsquo;ve worked for many are house-hold names.
I notice that lots of blogs just stick to a single topic and that might actually be for the best. However I often have thoughts on different subjects which interest me, and therefore I thought that this blog would be a good place for me to get my thoughts, and ideas out into the wider-world.</description></item></channel></rss>
